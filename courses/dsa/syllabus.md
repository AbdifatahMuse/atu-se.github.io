# Syllabus -- Draft

## Course Title

Data Structures and Algorithms

## Course

Year 2 / Semester 2

## Meeting Times

* Saturday @ 8:30 a.m.
* Sunday @ 10:30 a.m.
* Wednesday @ 8:30 a.m.

## Rationale
This course focuses on the study of data structures, algorithms and program efficiency. Topics include: analysis of time and space requirements of algorithms; program efficiency improving techniques, abstract data types such as linked lists, stacks, queues, trees (traversal, implementations); simple searching algorithms (linear search, binary search, … ), simple sorting algorithms (bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, … ), advanced sorting algorithms (merge sort, quick sort, heap sort … )


## Course Aims

The course aims:
-	To introduce the most common data structures like stack, queue, linked list
-	To give alternate methods of data organization and representation
-	To enable students use the concepts related to Data Structures and Algorithms to solve real world problems
-	 To practice Recursion, Sorting, and Searching on the different data structures
-	To implement the data structures with a chosen programming language

## Format and Procedures

### Attendance

Attendance is required and will be recorded and submitted to the department office.

### Participation

Student should attend all classes and participate in class discussion.  Outside of class, students should complete assigned reading and other assignments.  Students should follow along with the course website for supplemental instructional materials.

##  Prerequisites

*Fundamentals of Programming II*

## Required reading

* *Introduction to Java Programming, 10th Edition* (Liang)

## Grading Procedures

Late assignments will be received reduced credit at the teacher's discretion.


## Academic Integrity

You are encouraged to study together and to discuss information and concepts covered in lecture and the sections with other students. You can give "consulting" help to or receive "consulting" help from such students. However, this permissible cooperation should never involve one student having possession of a copy of all or part of work done by someone else, in the form of an e-mail, an e-mail attachment file, a flash drive, or a hard copy.  The only exception to this is assignments that are clearly described as group-work, and the expectations for that group work will be documented for those assignments.

Should copying occur, both the student who copied work from another student and the student who gave material to be copied may receive a zero for the assignment. Penalty for violation of this Code can also be extended to include failure of the course and University disciplinary action.

During examinations, you must do your own work. Talking or discussion is not permitted during the examinations, nor may you compare papers, copy from others, or collaborate in any way. Any collaborative behavior during the examinations may result in failure of the exam, and may lead to failure of the course and University disciplinary action.
