## Business Need

The purpose of this project is to increase awareness and access to the Abaarso Tech library and manage its operation.

## Business Requirements

We would like an information system that will provide the following capabilities:

* An on-site staff person should be able to easily check a textbook in or out, with a record of which person has checked out the book.  The system should allow the manual entry of a book's details or easy access using a dedicated barcode scanner or a mobile phone scanner
* A public website should advertise the contents of the library and whether or not they are currently available
* The system should allow an efficient means of adding books to the library using a dedicated barcode scanner or a mobile phone scanner.


# Expected Value

## Tangible

* The university will limit the financial losses associated with lost or stolen books.  The system will provide increased accountability, as the administration will be able to track who has checked out a book at any time.
* A well-functioning library system can help with student recruitment and retention, adding and maintaining revenue for the university.

## Intangible

* Students will have easier access and increased awareness of textbooks.
* With increased awareness of the library, interest in adding more valuable titles to the library will also be increased.  This may result in the acquisition of more titles that will add educational value to the institution.
* A well functioning library may add the prestige and reputation of the university.

## Special Issues or Constraints

Physical access the the library will be coordinated through the administration office.
