# System Request

## Project Name: Class Scheduling System

## Project Sponsor

* Name: Nick
* Department: Software Engineering
* Organization: ATU

## Business Need

The purpose of this project is to easily and quickly generate a course schedule and enable easy access to the schedule for students an staff.

## Business Requirements

* The tool should allow the user to enter the classes taught in a semester, which year they are for, the number of classrooms available, and which professors are teaching them the classes.  The output should be all possible of conflict-free scheduling options for the courses.
* When a course schedule is selected, users should be able to easily export the schedule in easy-to-read formats for the internet or for printing

# Expected Value

## Tangible

* Administration will save work time by having a tool automatically generate conflict-free schedules.

## Intangible

* Because the tool will quickly generate options, it will be easier to plan schedules in advance.  This will allow the administration and faculty to plan ahead of time, allowing additional time for curriculum or project development. This will reduce stress on administrative staff.
* Manually generating schedules sometimes leads to schedules with conflicts.  This can cause classes to be missed during semester transitions.  The scheduler will add educational value and limit frustration from students or staff.

## Special Issues or Constraints

Physical access the the library will be coordinated through the administration office.
