# Expected Value

## Tangible

* The system will reduce the risks of loss of the current analog audio archive.  Currently it is vulnerable to loss through fire, flood, theft, and decay of existing media.  Some recordings are one-of-a-kind and may never be recovered if lost.
* A modern information system will increase access to the recordings, which can increase the number of visitors to the cultural center.
* A modern information system will increase access to the recordings, which may increase academic research on the subject matter.  This could provide a financial benefit to the cultural center as it may attract grants or donations from the academic or charitable communities in order to expand research or further preservations efforts.

## Intangible

* Visitors to the cultural center will grow in their knowledge of Somali culture, which aligns with the mission and vision of the cultural center.
* The prestige and reputation of the culture center will be increased
* The world will have increase access to learn about Somali culture

## Special Issues or Constraints

The existing tapes are culturally significant and rare.  Special care should be taken in the handling of the tapes.  Loss or damage of the recordings is unacceptable.  Measures should be taken to make sure tapes are not damaged.

As noted in the requirements, the preservations of the digital recordings is also critical.
