    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, you will need to [download this database file](). It is a database with music data.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You should create a folder somewhere on your computer to manage exercises.  Maybe Documents/database_class.  \n",
    "2. Then for each exercise you can create a separate folder, like exercise2.  \n",
    "3. Place exercise2.db into the exercise2.db folder.  \n",
    "4. Make a copy of exercise2.db.  Call it *exercise2_original.db*.  Then if you need to refer back to the original database, you will have it readily available.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Opening an Existing Database\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to open an existing database.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A) From the Command Prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open your command prompt.\n",
    "2. Navigate to your *exercise2* folder.  If you've followed my suggestions, you may enter a commands like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "$>cd Documents/databases/exercise2\n",
    "exercise2$>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. When you have successfully reached the folder, do a directory listing.  If you've found the right folder, you should see your new database files, looking something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "exercise2$>            dir\n",
    "exercise1.db exercise2.db\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Now open the database with this command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "exercise2$>sqlite3 exercise1.db\n",
    "SQLite version 3.19.3 2017-06-27 16:48:08\n",
    "Enter \".help\" for usage hints.\n",
    "sqlite>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  Now you have opened the database!  Enter this command to show you which database you have opened, and its location:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sqlite\n",
    "sqlite>.database\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## B) From within the sqlite shell\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to open sqlite in whatever way you prefer  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. First though, you need to know the complete path to your database file.  I can't tell you exactly what that will be as it depends upon your system setup and folder structures.  Let's use *C:\\Users\\bob\\Documents\\exercise1\\exercise1.db* for this example.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Now, open sqlite from the Start Menu or from the command prompt. \n",
    "\n",
    "You should be at the sqlite shell:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sqlite\n",
    "sqlite>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Now enter `.open` followed by your full file path.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sqlite\n",
    "sqlite>.open C:\\Users\\bob\\Documents\\exercise1\\exercise1.db\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Did it work? \n",
    "\n",
    "If you did not enter the right path, it will simply create a new database at that location with that name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's check to see if the database opened.  exercise1.db should have 11 tables in it.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. List the tables:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sqlite\n",
    "sqlite> .tables\n",
    "albums          employees       invoices        playlists\n",
    "artists         genres          media_types     tracks\n",
    "customers       invoice_items   playlist_track\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't have output like this, then check the path to your database and try step #3 again.  When you successfully list the tables, you're ready to move on to the next step. \n",
    "\n",
    "# 2 Enter a SQL Query\n",
    "\n",
    "The moment we've all been waiting for.  Let's enter a SQL query.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sqlite\n",
    "sqlite> select * from artists;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Did you get a list of artists?  If so, congratulations, you've entered your first SQL query.\n",
    "\n",
    "Time for exercise 1c.\n",
    "\n"
