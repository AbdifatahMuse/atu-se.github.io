# Week 10
[Stonybrook: Context-Free Grammar Lecture 1](lectures/cfg1.pdf)

# Week 9
* [DFA to Regular Expression Conversion Using Arden's Theorem](ardenstheorem)
# Week 8
* Announcement:  Quiz on Wednesday, March 7, covering these topics (See lecture notes below and in ):
  - Regular Expressions (review textbook pp 52-59).  Be prepared to list example strings given a regular expression, and be prepared to draw a DFA given a regular expression.
  - NFA to DFA Conversion (review textbook 41-47 and lecture notes below)
  - ~~DFA Minimization (review textbook 41-47 and lecture notes below)~~ Note: I have decided to remove DFA minimization from the quiz.  Study the other topics well!
* [DFA Minimization Lecture Notes](dfaminimization)
