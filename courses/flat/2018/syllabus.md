## Rationale
This course aims to develop the theoretical foundations of computer science through study of mathematical and abstract models of computers and the theory of formal languages. It also, introduces some fundamental concepts in automata theory and formal languages including grammar, finite automaton, regular expression, formal language, pushdown automaton, and Turing machine. Not only do they form basic models of computation, they are also the foundation of many branches of computer science, e.g. compilers, software engineering, concurrent systems, etc.


## Course Aims
* Introduce concepts in automata theory and theory of computation
*	Study the central concepts of automata theory
*	Acquire insights into the relationship among formal languages, formal grammars, and automata.
*	Identify different formal language classes and their relationships
*	Design grammars and recognizers for different formal languages
*	Prove or disprove theorems in automata theory using its properties
*	Familiar with thinking analytically and intuitively for problem solving situations in related areas of theory in computer science.




## Format and Procedures

### Attendance

Attendance is required and will be recorded and submitted to the department office.

### Participation

Student should attend all classes and participate in class discussion.  Outside of class, students should complete assigned reading and other assignments.  Students should follow along with the course website for supplemental instructional materials.

##  My Assumptions

Students should have an understanding of material from Discrete Mathematics course.  If this is a challenge, students should pursue extra remedial study to prepare them for the material in this class.

## Course Requirements

### Required reading
* [*Introduction to Theory of Computation* (Maheshwari/Smid)](http://cglab.ca/~michiel/TheoryOfComputation/TheoryOfComputation.pdf)

### Lecture Textbook
* [*An Introduction to Automata Theory & Formal Language* (Pandey)](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Automata-Theory-Formal/dp/8188458473/)

### Supplemental readings
Supplemental reading and other materials will be linked on the [course website](https://atu-se.github.io/courses/ftl/).  Students are responsible for regularly checking the course website for updates.




## Grading Procedures

* 10% Attendance
* 40% Final
* 30% Mid-Term
* 20% Assignments: Quizzes, Homework, etc.

Late assignments will be received reduced credit at the teacher's discretion.


## Academic Integrity

You are encouraged to study together and to discuss information and concepts covered in lecture and the sections with other students. You can give "consulting" help to or receive "consulting" help from such students. However, this permissible cooperation should never involve one student having possession of a copy of all or part of work done by someone else, in the form of an e-mail, an e-mail attachment file, a flash drive, or a hard copy.

Should copying occur, both the student who copied work from another student and the student who gave material to be copied may receive a zero for the assignment. Penalty for violation of this Code can also be extended to include failure of the course and University disciplinary action.

During examinations, you must do your own work. Talking or discussion is not permitted during the examinations, nor may you compare papers, copy from others, or collaborate in any way. Any collaborative behavior during the examinations may result in failure of the exam, and may lead to failure of the course and University disciplinary action.
