## Updates

### Lecture 2 28-Jan

* [Lecture #2 Slides: Non-deterministic Finite Automata](lectures/Lecture2.pdf)
* Homework #1 is due today
  - I have postponed this again as noted in the Assignments table above
  - Every student should have his/her own paper
  - Group size should be a maximum of three people
* [Homework #2](homework/homework2.md) has been posted
* Required reading: 1.3-1.4.  After this you should have completed reading Chapter 0 and Chapter 1.


### Class Update 26-Jan

* With so many people missing Lecture 1, we used 23-Jan to review Lecture 1 and go over the pretest.  I have postponed the due date for the homework and we will pick up Lecture 2 on Monday.


### Lecture 1b  23-Jan

* Today we will discussed the Pretest
* ~~Homework #1 is due today~~ Postponed
* [Homework #2](homework/homework2.md) has been posted.
* Required reading: 1.3-1.4.  After this you should have completed reading Chapter 0 and Chapter 1.
* ~~Lecture #2: Non-deterministic Finite Automata~~ Postponed
* I have created a [summary page of important definitions, theorems, etc.](definitions_and_theorems.md) from our textbook for your convenience.  You should learn these well.



### Class Update 22-Jan

* The results of the pretest covering material from Discrete Math were poor.  Please review chapter 0 carefully.  Study up on these topics:
  * Interpreting a formal description of a set. e.g The set {1, 3, 5, 7, ...} is: the set of all odd, positive integers.
  * Be able to read an information description of a set and write a formal description.
  * Be familiar with the symbols used for Natural numbers, Integers, Rational numbers, etc.
  * Be able to identify subsets and understand the notation
  * Be able to do set intersection, set union, cross-product, and power sets.
  * Understand the domain and range of functions

### Lecture 1 - 21-Jan

* [Lecture Slides: Introduction to Finite Automata](lectures/Lecture1.pdf)
* Pretest
* Required reading: Chapter 0.1 -- 1.2
* Required [Homework #1](homework/homework1.md).
  * Show your effort
  * Follow group work requirements carefully
  * If you don't make sure that you understand group work, your grades will suffer in quizzes and exams
  * This homework will be graded!
