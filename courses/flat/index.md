## Textbook

* *[Introduction to the Theory of Computation -- 3rd Edition (Sipser)](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Theory-Computation-Michael-Sipser/dp/113318779X)*

## Supplemental Reading

* [*Book of Proof*](https://www.people.vcu.edu/~rhammack/BookOfProof/BookOfProof.pdf)

## Definitions and Theorems

I have created a [summary page of important definitions, theorems, etc.](definitions_and_theorems.md) from our textbook for your convenience.  You should know these well.

# Lecture 2 - 23-Jan

* Today we will discuss the Pretest
* Homework #1 is due today
* [Homework #2](homework/homework2.md) has been posted.  It is due Monday, 28-Jan.
* Required reading: 1.3-1.4.  After this you should have completed reading Chapter 0 and Chapter 1.
* Lecture #2: Non-deterministic Finite Automata
* I have created a [summary page of important definitions, theorems, etc.](definitions_and_theorems.md) from our textbook for your convenience.  You should learn these well.

# Class Update 22-Jan

* The results of the pretest covering material from Discrete Math were poor.  Please review chapter 0 carefully.  Study up on these topics:
  * Interpreting a formal description of a set. e.g The set {1, 3, 5, 7, ...} is: the set of all odd, positive integers.
  * Be able to read an information description of a set and write a formal description.
  * Be familiar with the symbols used for Natural numbers, Integers, Rational numbers, etc.
  * Be able to identify subsets and understand the notation
  * Be able to do set intersection, set union, cross-product, and power sets.
  * Understand the domain and range of functions

# Lecture 1 - 21-Jan

* [Lecture Slides: Introduction to Finite Automata](lectures/Lecture1.pdf)
* Pretest
* Required reading: Chapter 0.1 -- 1.2
* Required [Homework #1](homework/homework1.md) due Wednesday 23-Jan.
  * Show your effort
  * Follow group work requirements carefully
  * If you don't make sure that you understand group work, your grades will suffer in quizzes and exams
  * This homework will be graded!
